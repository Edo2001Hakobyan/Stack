Usage Makefile.
To use the Makefile to build and compile your C++ program, navigate to the directory containing the Makefile in a terminal and enter the command make. This will build the default target, which is usually the main executable file. You can also use the following commands:
1.make clean: Remove all files generated by the build process.
2.make run: Run the program to the system, if specified in the Makefile.
