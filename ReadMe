Stack in c++.
A stack is a data structure that allows you to insert and remove elements from the top. It follows the LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) principle.

Inserting elements.
To insert an element into the stack, you can use the push() method.

Removing elements.
To remove the element at the top of the stack, you can use the pop() method.
This removes the element at the top of the stack. Note that you cannot use the pop() method on an empty stack.

Accessing elements.
To access the element at the top of the stack without removing it, you can use the top() method.

Checking if the Stack is Empty.
To check if the stack is empty, you can use the is_empty() method.

Usage Makefile. 
To use the Makefile to build and compile your C++ program, navigate to the directory containing the Makefile in a terminal and enter the command make. This will build the default target, which is usuall the main executable file. You can also use the following commands:
1.make clean: Remove all files generated by the build process. 
2.make run: Run the program to the system, if specified in the Makefile.
